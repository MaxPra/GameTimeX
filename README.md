# GameTimeX
GameTimeX allows you to monitor your game time. 
Tired of the inaccurate monitoring of steam (because you left the game run in idle when you were afk)?

Then this little application will help you for sure :).

Download the latest stable version here (for windows only)!

## About this application
This application is a little holiday hobby project I got myself into :).

### The main window
By the time you start this application the first time, you are going to see something like this:

Let me explain the different sections in the main window:

1. At the top of the window you have the profile-search-bar - you can search for games here (if the list gets too long and you don't want to scroll through them all).
2. Next to the search-bar you find three buttons ("create new profile", "Delete Profile", "Settings")
3. In the right section of the screen you can see the "information section" - this section displays the data of the currently selected profile (also a little profile image is shown)
4. In this "information section" you can start/stop the time monitoring by simply pressing the button at the bottom of the section (blue indicates no current monitoring, red indicates running monitoring)
5. You can also rename the currently selected game profile by clicking on the pen right next to the profile name (also displayed in the "information display")

After adding a game profile (you can do that by clicking on the paper and pen icon in the toolbar) it would look something like this:

If you are unhappy with the profile name or the picture you chose, no worries - you can adjust them by clicking on the pen icon (name) or clicking on "Change Image".

If you hover over the little clock next to "Game time" you will see the monitored time in minutes (game time is normally shown in hours).

You can also see the first time you played the game and when you last played the game.

### The settings
Now that I have explained the main window, lets explain the settings window now:

In the settings window, you have the option to backup the profiles as well as importing an existing backup.
This can come in handy if you reset your computer or if you want to move to another computer at some time (or simply because you were a fool and deleted an important profile ;))
As stated in the window itself the application will restart automatically when importing or exporting a backup.

### Image profile cropping
If you create a new game profile. You have to choose an image that will be displayed in the "info display" later.
You can choose whatever picture you like. After choosing your picture via the file explorer you are going to see this window:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/396e4d83-66af-454f-bf59-b03509f3d5ff)

Here you can crop your image as you want (select the game text or a section that suits best).

The controls are the following:
- Change size of cropping section (mousewheel up / mousewheel down)
- Drag the cropping section by holding the left mousebutton down

If you are happy with the the section you chose, just click on the "X" at the top right corner to save the cropped section of the image.
