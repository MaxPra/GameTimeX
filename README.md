# GameTimeX

GameTimeX is a desktop application for precise tracking of actual gameplay time.  
Unlike platform counters that may continue running while a title is idle, GameTimeX records playtime only when the game is truly active.

**Version 2.0.11 — “Retouched”**  
Same core functionality, redesigned user interface.

Download the latest installer:  
[GameTimeXSetup_Latest.msi](https://github.com/MaxPra/GameTimeX/releases/download/Version2.0.11/GameTimeXSetup_Latest.msi)

## Key Features

- **Accurate Time Tracking** – records only while the game process is genuinely running.
- **Installed Games Filter** *(controller + play icon)* – optional toolbar filter that shows only profiles for games that are currently installed (installation folder exists).  
  *Prerequisite:* the installation folder must be specified in each profile’s **Properties**.
- **Automatic Profile Switching** – switches to the correct profile when a game launches.  
  - Per-executable selection to prevent conflicts where different games share executables.  
  - Smart initial pre-filtering automatically deselects common non-game executables (launchers, crash reporters, helpers, etc.).
- **Customizable Profiles** – create, rename, and assign cropped images for each game.
- **OLED Care (Blackout Screen)** – toggle with **CTRL+B** to black out all displays while AFK.
- **Side-Screen Dimming** – optionally dims secondary displays automatically while tracking is active.
- **Hotkey Monitoring** – start/stop tracking via a configurable hotkey.
- **Backup & Restore** – export or import all profiles; optional automatic backup at startup.
- **Hardened Database Access** – parameterized SQLite queries for protection against SQL injection.

## What’s New in 2.0.11

- Complete visual refresh of the UI
- Removal of the legacy list view
- Minor UI-related fixes and refinements
- **Installed Games Filter** *(controller + play icon)* – new toolbar toggle to display **only profiles for installed games** (installation folder exists).  
  *Prerequisite:* set the game’s installation folder in the profile **Properties**.
- **OLED Care (Blackout Screen)** – toggle anytime with **CTRL+B** to fully darken all screens while away
- **Optional side-screen dimming while tracking** – automatically dims all non-primary displays while GameTimeX is actively tracking; restores displays afterwards
- **Security: SQL-injection hardening** – all database access uses parameterized SQLite queries
- **Executable selection for Automatic Profile Switching** – define the exact executables to monitor for profile switching; avoids collisions with shared executables
- **Smart executable pre-filtering** – on first profile creation, non-game executables (launchers, crash reporters, helpers, benchmarks) are deselected automatically

## Overview

GameTimeX is designed for reliability and clarity, with an emphasis on clean interaction and accurate tracking.

### Main Window

Initial application view:  
<img width="1208" height="813" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9866aa9b-2c03-4039-81b8-02dd83b425ae" />

**Key areas:**

1. **Profile Search** – quickly locate profiles in larger libraries.  
2. **Toolbar Controls** – next to the search field:  
   - **Installed Games Filter** *(controller + play icon)* – shows only profiles where the game is currently installed (installation folder exists).  
     *Prerequisite:* define the installation folder in **Properties**.  
   - Create New Profile  
   - Delete Profile  
   - Properties  
   - Settings  
   (Properties and Delete are also available via the profile context menu.)
3. **Information Panel** – details for the selected profile, including thumbnail.  
4. **Start/Stop Monitoring** – status indicated by button color (blue = idle, red = active).  
5. **Rename Profile** – click the pencil icon next to the profile name.

Example with profiles:  
<img width="1216" height="816" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69a4db40-2477-429b-b863-46894fc5a2a4" />

Profile names and images are editable at any time. Hover over the “i” icon next to *Game Time* to view the tracked minutes, as well as the first and last play sessions.

If a new playthrough begins after time has already been recorded, use **New Playthrough Startpoint**. The application saves the current total time and reports playthrough time as the difference from that point forward.  
- **Total time** remains cumulative.  
- **Playthrough time** is calculated relative to the saved start point.

## Settings

The settings dialog provides granular control:  
<img width="529" height="730" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4e36339-03aa-4b14-a7a9-5d5bbab2a9c9" />
<img width="533" height="729" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a99536a0-5d8a-4dd9-996d-a1e753bba252" />

**Options include:**

- **Session Time Tracking** – display the current session duration in the information panel while tracking.
- **Automatic Profile Switching** – automatically switches profiles upon game launch (requires the installation folder).  
  - Manage the set of **executables** to monitor and exclude irrelevant processes.
- **Monitor Key** – assign a global hotkey to start/stop monitoring without leaving the game.
- **Backup & Restore** – export or import profiles; the application restarts automatically after import/export. Optional automatic backup on startup.
- **OLED Care (Blackout Screen)** – fully darkens all screens to protect OLED panels (CTRL+B).
- **Side-Screen Dimming (optional)** – dims all secondary displays **only while tracking**; automatically restores them afterwards.

*Tip:* For Steam titles, locate the installation folder via **Steam → Game → Properties → Installed Files → Browse**.

## Manage Executables

When Automatic Profile Switching is enabled, GameTimeX allows precise control over which executables are monitored.  
This prevents launchers, helpers, and engine processes from causing false detections.

<img width="554" height="494" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/920efc3b-2073-4004-bc3e-d52988125172" />

**Capabilities:**

- Enumerates executables in the installation directory  
- Checkboxes to mark executables as *active* or *inactive*  
- “Select All” for rapid bulk changes  
- Smart defaults: common non-game executables are deselected on initial profile creation  
- Changes can be saved at any time

## Profile Image Cropping

When adding a profile image, a cropping dialog enables quick framing:  
<img width="1211" height="814" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a94e01b8-0482-459e-9d6a-a213b8a56f8d" />

**Controls:**

- Resize the crop area with the mouse wheel  
- Reposition the crop area via drag (left mouse button)

The cropped image is saved and immediately shown in the profile view.

---

## Security

- All database operations use parameterized SQLite commands to mitigate SQL injection risks.  
- Initial executable pre-filtering reduces noise from non-game processes, improving detection accuracy.
