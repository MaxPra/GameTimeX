# GameTimeX

GameTimeX is a desktop application for precise tracking of actual gameplay time.  
Unlike platform counters that may continue running while a title is idle, GameTimeX records playtime only when the game is truly active.

**Version 2.1.0**  
Same reliable core, new refinements and yearly playtime statistics in December.

## Overview

GameTimeX is designed for reliability and clarity, with an emphasis on clean interaction and accurate tracking.

### Main Window

Initial application view:  
<img width="1191" height="786" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79ce0126-9752-4b1f-a071-052e46dfc2bf" />

**Key areas:**

1. **Profile Search** – quickly locate profiles in larger libraries.  
2. **Toolbar Controls** – next to the search field:  
   - **Installed Games Filter** *(controller + play icon)* – shows only profiles where the game is currently installed (installation folder exists).  
     *Prerequisite:* define the installation folder in **Properties**.  
   - Create New Profile  
   - Delete Profile  
   - Properties  
   - Settings  
   (Properties and Delete are also available via the profile context menu.)
3. **Profile Tiles with Install Indicator** – each game profile shows its image; if the game is installed, a **small install icon appears in the top-right corner**.  
   Example of a profile tile with the install icon:  
   <img width="191" height="219" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bdc29b4-df16-4bd4-b04e-bce4052f83dc" />
4. **Information Panel** – details for the selected profile, including thumbnail.  
5. **Start/Stop Monitoring** – status indicated by button color (blue = idle, red = active).  
6. **Rename Profile** – click the pencil icon next to the profile name.

Example with profiles:  
<img width="1188" height="787" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff8e56e5-81e5-4298-bbd0-1bfe558742dd" />

Profile names and images are editable at any time. Hover over the “i” icon next to *Game Time* to view the tracked minutes, as well as the first and last play sessions.  
➡️ The tooltip now also shows **how many hours you played today**.  
➡️ **New in 2.1.0:** in December, an **automatic yearly summary** shows how much time you spent in each game throughout the current year.  
➡️ **New:** profile pictures can now be pasted directly from the clipboard using **CTRL+V** in the **Create** and **Properties** windows.

If a new playthrough begins after time has already been recorded, use **New Playthrough Startpoint**. The application saves the current total time and reports playthrough time as the difference from that point forward.  
- **Total time** remains cumulative.  
- **Playthrough time** is calculated relative to the saved start point.

## Properties & Steam Linking

The **Properties window** provides central configuration for each profile:

- Define the **installation folder** for installed game detection  
- Assign profile image, rename profile, and manage monitored executables  
- **Paste from Clipboard:** profile images can now be inserted directly from the clipboard via **CTRL+V**.  
- **Steam Integration:**  
  - Shows whether the profile is already linked to a Steam game  
  - A dedicated **Steam button with link icon** allows importing and linking Steam games directly  
  - When linked, Steam games can be launched straight from GameTimeX  
  - Optional: enable **HDR activation before launch**  
  - **Steam Start Parameters:** specify custom Steam launch arguments per game profile  
  - **SteamGridDB Shortcut:**  
    - Via the **SteamGridDB button** (available during profile creation or in the Properties window), SteamGridDB is opened directly in your browser with the **correct game already selected**.  
    - Simply copy the desired artwork from SteamGridDB, paste it into the image textbox, and you’re done.

## Settings

The settings dialog provides granular control:  
<img width="524" height="722" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79e8355a-8bc2-476d-b8be-bc6981896653" />

**Options include:**

- **Session Time Tracking** – display the current session duration in the information panel while tracking.
- **Automatic Profile Switching** – automatically switches profiles upon game launch (requires the installation folder).  
  - Manage the set of **executables** to monitor and exclude irrelevant processes.
- **Monitor Key** – assign a global hotkey to start/stop monitoring without leaving the game.
- **Backup & Restore** – export or import profiles; the application restarts automatically after import/export. Optional automatic backup on startup.
- **OLED Care (Blackout Screen)** – fully darkens all screens to protect OLED panels (CTRL+B).
- **Side-Screen Dimming (optional)** – dims all secondary displays **only while tracking**; automatically restores them afterwards.
- **Steam Integration Options** – choose whether HDR should be toggled automatically when launching a Steam-linked game, and configure **per-game Steam launch parameters**.

## Manage Executables

When Automatic Profile Switching is enabled, GameTimeX allows precise control over which executables are monitored.  
This prevents launchers, helpers, and engine processes from causing false detections.

**Capabilities:**

- Enumerates executables in the installation directory  
- Checkboxes to mark executables as *active* or *inactive*  
- “Select All” for rapid bulk changes  
- Smart defaults: common non-game executables are deselected on initial profile creation  
- Changes can be saved at any time

---

## Profile Image Cropping

When adding a profile image, a cropping dialog enables quick framing:  
<img width="788" height="491" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1b1ac7e-77e5-421c-b940-37a9cfab78a5" />

**Controls:**

- Resize the crop area with the mouse wheel  
- Reposition the crop area via drag (left mouse button)
- **New:** profile images can also be pasted directly from the clipboard using **CTRL+V** in the **Create** and **Properties** windows.

The cropped image is saved and immediately shown in the profile view.

---

## Security

- All database operations use parameterized SQLite commands to mitigate SQL injection risks.  
- Initial executable pre-filtering reduces noise from non-game processes, improving detection accuracy.
